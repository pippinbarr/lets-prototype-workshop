# Let’s Prototype Ancient Greek Punishment

*A very short-form game design workshop.*

## Let’s Play: Ancient Greek Punishment

Our conceptual starting point is a series of digital games I made between 2011 and 2019 (more to come? will I steal your ideas?) about mythological Greek punishments.

- [The original game](https://pippinbarr.com/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment/info/) (2011)
- [The variations](https://pippinbarr.com/ideas/ancient-greek-punishment/) (2015–2019)

Let's gooooooo...

## The constraints

In order to *actually prototype a game*, we're going to constrain ourselves in three keys ways.

1. We'll choose a *pre-existing game* and/or *prototyping materials* (**the form**)
2. We'll choose a *pre-existing story and setting* (**the myth**)
3. We'll choose a *very specific idea or experience we want to communicate* (**the experience**)

---

These things will inevitably influence each other. Whichever one you start out with is completely fine.

### Example

In the original digital game version of Sisyphus, for example, I had

1. Form: highly simple minigames in the style of WarioWare
2. Myth: Sisyphus
3. Experience goal: communicate *eternal* punishment dynamically, alluding to the repetitive (pointless?) labour of many videogames (so deep)

## Why do this?

- Understand [The Stuff Games Are Made Of](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546119/the-stuff-games-are-made-of/)
- Training as a [Reflective Practitioner](https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/9-schon.html)
- Understand Greek Mythology in a New Way
- Communicate your ideas in the language of play
- Constraints Are Good For Creative Process and You Know It

## 1. The form

When you're making a game in a small amount of time, or are just inexperienced, a great way to start out is with a game or activity that *already exists* and just... *change it*.

- [PONGS](https://pippinbarr.com/pongs/info/) (2012)
- [BREAKSOUT](https://pippinbarr.com/breaksout/info/) (2015)
- [SNAKISMS](https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISMS/info/) (2017)
- [CHESSES](https://pippinbarr.com/chesses/info/) (2019)

We're not going to have time to make digital game variations, so we'll need to choose games/activities that we can physically prototype...

### Bodies?

- Folk games (hopscotch, tag, hide and seek, ...)
- Sports (wrestling, hurdles, baseball, ...)
- Exercise (pushups, situps, running, ...)
- Literalism (pushing a heavy object, chaining someone to a rock, ...)

### Analog games?

- Cards (go fish, poker, snap, ...)
- Dice (gambling, ...)
- Board games (snakes and ladders, monopoly, chess, ...)
- Social deducation games (werewolf/mafia, the resistance, )
- LARP (a scenario and rules for roleplay, ...)
- TTRPG (dungeons and dragons, ...)

### Just Rules?

- Social Media Challenges (the ice-bucket challenge, TikTok dances, face wax, ...)
- Rule-based Conceptual Art (Sol LeWitt, John Cage, fluxus, ...)

---

Let your mind start to see if it gravitates toward any particular games or activities. Familiarity and simplicity are usually a good idea...

### Examples

- "Go Fish" but you have to catch cards as they are thrown to you (+athleticism)
- "Snakes and Ladders" but you play as the snakes and ladders (+angels and demons)
- "Hide and seek" but you all play with your eyes closed within 10 feet of each other (+sonic awareness)
- These are not good ideas! But someone should make them anyway just in case they are *great* ideas!

## 2. The myth(s)

It can be very helpful to have a specific narrative/story framing available as a kind of *pre-determined* element to our design process. We're going to use myths of punishment from Greek mythology because they are simple and evocative.

- [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) was sentenced to eternally push a boulder to the top of a slope, only to see it roll back down and to begin again
- [Tantalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalus) was hungry and thirsty but every time he reached for a fruit or stooped for water it moved away from him
- [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus) was chained to a rock and doomed to have an eagle eat his liver every day
- [The Danaids](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dana%C3%AFdes) had to fill a bathtub one bucket at a time, but the bathtub had holes that meant they could never fill it
- [Zeno of Elea](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zeno_of_Elea) came up with the idea the movement is important because to get somewhere you have to get halfway, then halfway again, and so on

--

Again, see if your mind gravitates toward one of these naturally and let it start making notional pairings between myth and form.

Find the specificities in your myth to start to unlock the potential - consider reading about it in more depth? *Why* were they punished? Did they ever *escape*? Do we know how they *felt* about it all?

### Examples

Different myths may have different affordances for design...

- The myth of Sisyphus involves incredible *physicality and strain*, as well as Camus' assertion that Sisyphus might be... happy?
- The myth of Prometheus involves suffering *inflicted on a restrained body*, a very different dynamic to the endless tasks of the others
- Zeno of Elea was not (as far as we know) punished by the Gods, but should he have been?
- Tantalus could evoke a key emotion of *ever frustrated longing*
- The Danaids tell a story of using the wrong tool for the job

## 3. The experience

What do we want a player of our game (or simply "experiencer of our experience") to think about and feel?

### Connecting with the Myth?

One option is to use our Form as an opportunity to create a deeper or distinctive connection to the myth itself.

- The physicality of the protagonist?
- The emotions of the protagonist?
  - "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy." ??? (Albert Camus in [*The Myth of Sisyphus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus))
- The thoughts of the protagonist?
- Something High Concept like eternity?
- The punisher's (Zeus, usually, right?) perspective?
- The broader context and rationale for the punishment?

### Myth as Metaphor?

We could also choose to prioritize an experience or idea that the myth is well-suited (combined with our Form) to explore.

- A meditation on punishment in contemporary society? (As "corrective," retribution, reformation, futile, cruel, ...)
- The madness of the gods?
- Forgiveness?
- Hopeless repetition as a meditation on contemporary or future life?
- How the punishment could have been improved? What would Silicon Valley do? How would techbros disrupt the punishment market?
- The pleasures of repetitive action? The pleasures of *observing* repetitive action?

## Design time

1. Form small teams (2-3 perhaps?)
2. Have a quick chat an introduce yourselves to each other
3. Five minutes (timed!) of high-speed idea generation individually
    - We're looking for an idea every 20 seconds (15 ideas total)
    - Each idea should include Form, Myth, and Experience
4. Discuss the ideas generated and choose one to prototype
5. 20 minutes (timed!) to prototype it with the materials to hand
    - It doesn’t have to be good! It probably shouldn't be!
    - If you finish early start another prototype!
    - Give them *titles*, it is fun!
6. Show and tell time as a group
    - Tell us the title and explain the basic form-myth-experience (though keep the experience secret if you want to)
    - Demo your prototype yourselves or with others depending on comfort level

## Some questions for discussion

- How easy did you find it to succinctly express what your prototype is meant to convey?
- And does it convey that? *How* does it?
- What does your myth/experience teach you about your materials?
- What do your materials teach your about your myth/experience?
- Is your prototype "the same as" a written account or animation of the myth? Why?

These are *not the only questions* to think about.
