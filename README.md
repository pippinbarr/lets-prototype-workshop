## The myths

- [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) was sentenced to eternally push a boulder to the top of a slope, only to see it roll back down and to begin again
- [Tantalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalus) was hungry and thirsty but every time he reached for a fruit or stooped for water it moved away from him
- [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus) was chained to a rock and doomed to have an eagle eat his liver every day
- [The Danaids](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dana%C3%AFdes) had to fill a bathtub one bucket at a time, but the bathtub had holes that meant they could never fill it
- [Zeno of Elea](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zeno_of_Elea) came up with the idea the movement is important because to get somewhere you have to get halfway, then halfway again, and so on

Choose one in your head.

## Groupthink

### Big Ideas

What about our myth should we try to convey?

- The physicality of the protagonist?
- The emotions of the protagonist?
- Something High Concept like eternity?
- An understanding of punishment? (As retribution, reformation, futile, cruel, ...)
- The punisher's perspective?
- The madness of the gods?
- The broader context and rationale?
- Forgiveness?
- Its potential as a metaphor for contemporary or future life?
- How the punishment could have been improved?
- "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."??? (Albert Camus in [*The Myth of Sisyphus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus))
- A vibe?

### Materials

What materials and framings can we use and what do they imply? Start thinking about how they link up to Big Ideas.

#### Bodies?

- Folk games (hopscotch, tag, hide and seek, ...)
- Sports (wrestling, hurdles, baseball, ...)
- Exercise (pushups, situps, running, ...)
- Literalism (pushing a heavy object, chaining someone to a rock, ...)

#### Analog games?

- Cards (go fish, poker, snap, ...)
- Dice (gambling, ...)
- Board games (snakes and ladders, monopoly, chess, ...)
- LARP (a scenario and rules for roleplay, ...)
- TTRPG (dungeons and dragons, ...)

#### Rules?

- Social Media Challenges (the ice-bucket challenge, TikTok dances, face wax, ...)
- Rule-based Conceptual Art (Sol LeWitt, John Cage, fluxus, ...)

#### A tiny, fast game engine?

Though probably only if you already know how to use it

## Teamthink

- Form teams of 2–3 (or more)
- Agree on a myth
- Five minutes of high-intensity idea generation
- Discuss and refine ideas as a team, choose one (or more)
- 20 minutes to prototype it (it doesn’t have to be good)
- Teams pair up to demo prototypes
- Full-group demo of all prototypes + discussion

If there is time: repeat

## Questions for Discussion

- Can you succinctly express what your prototype is meant to convey? - And does it convey that? How does it?
- What does the myth teach us about our materials?
- What do the materials teach us about the myth?
- Is your prototype “the same as” a written account or animation of the myth? Why?
