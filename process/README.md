# Seriously, you're going to write process for this?

Yeah.

Well how did that workshop go? Totally fine in the sense that we had a really generative/fun conversation that was, I think, spurred on and instigated by the core idea of the workshop -- that is how do you go from a story/myth toward game design.

But it's certainly true that we did absolutely nothing practical and that was... well maybe a lost opportunity, although *that* said we only had an hour.

So, if I have two hours in Texas, how would I think about what I have and how it might shift a bit?

- First 40-60 minutes as a group time to discuss and collectively find ideas for reasonable prototype
- Second hour as prototyping cycle (30 mins?) and group sharing and discussion (30 mins?)
- That seems more likely to invite some actually productive work
- BUT it's hard for people to just jump in and design and work so how to stimulate that?
- The "forced ideation" thing is a useful idea
- Definitely bring (one or more) decks of cards? I really felt like I wished we had them when we kicked off (we only had notepads and ourselves and some chairs and a table)
- It would be smart to preload at least a handful of diverse design ideas to demonstrate the kind of scale that might be reasonable?
- Modding might be a better/tighter frame to stick to? More like "how can you change Go Fish into Myth?" "how can you change hide and seek into Myth"
- Are the myths themselves the right starting point? Or do they feel kind of played out in part because of their simplicity but also because I've already done it so many times? Find some new stuff as the material? Like it could be the title of the session, but now totally what we do?
- I need to run this on Monday and it's Friday right now so I should be kind of careful about how much I change as well, limited time (lots of time in travel mode though I suppose)
- Convo with Rilla will help
- How do I make it simple enough that people from any background can engage (add structure) but rich enough that they can potentially find something powerful to think about (the specific story/activity?)
- It is reasonable to compress down to two hours a whole dev cycle from idea to prototype? Yes, you can, but can you if you've never done it before?
- Maybe it's better to present them with very specific games and challenges (that I have ideas for preloaded) and let the ones who want to branch off as needed?
- That whole thing of *context* is really interesting for complicating everything and considering what matters, what you're trying to do... experience goals.

### Pretty random notes from the U of U version

- Oedipus - blinded for "knowledge"
- Detective stories as a form? (Mafia, werewolf, The Golden Idol, ...)
- Ankh-Morpork (Discworld game)
  - Who are the *characters*?
  - The "Chaos Character"? The "Fate" Character, making it happen.
- Darkest Dungeon - games where the game is a character
  - Explicitly being toyed with
- The Oregon Trail
- BEING FAIR?
- Noir Syndrome
